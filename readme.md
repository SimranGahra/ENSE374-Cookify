## Project Overview

The **Cookify** is a web-based application that helps users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have. The app integrates with an external API to fetch recipes and stores user-specific data such as saved recipes and playlists in a local database. This hybrid approach ensures users have access to up-to-date recipe options while enjoying personalized features.

### **Objective**
To create a scalable and user-friendly recipe suggestion platform that promotes cooking at home, reduces food waste, and helps users discover new meal ideas using ingredients they already have.
